# Revolutionizing-Currency-Exchange-The-Future-of-Travel-and-Crypto 

 Making easy exchange  between native and international currencies !!

## What we actually want to do ?
In todays world where we still  have to exchange currencies at a currency exchange center making it a lot expensive and uncenterain to buy it from. However this where we come into  play by simply putting an app in front 
of the customers where one can simply put in there money  into the app's wallet via  online transcations which is then convereted and stored in the form of a stable crypto currency like usdt moving forward a stable can be 
withdrawn in any form of fiat which can be either dollar or yen and many more currrenies.  we put in the use of blockchain to make each transaction safe and sound as well as equaly fast 

## The Business model 
### ðŸ’¸ Transaction Fees
- *How it Works*: Charge a small fee for each currency exchange or transfer made through the app.
- *Pros*:
  - Directly tied to usage: More transactions mean more revenue.
  - Users pay only when they use the service.
- *Cons*:
  - May discourage frequent transactions if fees are perceived as high.
  - Revenue can be inconsistent and dependent on transaction volume.

### ðŸ’³ Subscription Model
- *How it Works*: Offer a subscription plan where users pay a monthly or yearly fee for access to premium features or unlimited transactions.
- *Pros*:
  - Predictable and consistent revenue stream.
  - Can attract heavy users who prefer the convenience of a flat rate.
- *Cons*:
  - Users may be hesitant to subscribe without first experiencing the service.
  - Requires clear value proposition to justify the recurring cost.

- *Cons*:
  - More complex pricing structure to manage and communicate to users.
